## Create a Scene

Whether you are creating a whole world or just placing one model into a web page you need a scene to contain the world or model, a camera to view it, a light to illuminate it, and at least one viewable object as a model.

## Code Snippets

### Basic Scene Syntax

The code below reflects the basic syntax needed to create a Babylon.js scene.

```javascript
var createScene = function () {
    //Creating a Babylon Scene Object, using the babylon engine.
    var scene = new BABYLON.Scene(engine);

    return scene;
};
```

### Camera

We will create an ArcRotateCamera object for our application, which allows us to spin around the camera attachment and see the world we are creating.

```javascript
    //Create a camera object, which allows us to see the world we're building.
    var camera = new BABYLON.ArcRotateCamera("camera", -Math.PI / 2, Math.PI / 2.5, 10, new BABYLON.Vector3(0, 0, 0));
    //Define where the camera will be attached, in this case the canvas we are working in.
    camera.attachControl(canvas, true);
```

### Light

The next step is to create a light. For this application we will create a HemisphericLight object that illuminates the whole canvas from above.

```javascript
    //Creates a hemispheric light for the scene (allows for visibility of our objects)
    const light = new BABYLON.HemisphericLight("light", new BABYLON.Vector3(0, 1, 0), scene);
```

### Ground

Once the light is set up, we will want to create a ground object to provide a more world-like scenario.

```javascript
    //Creates a ground object, which allows us to have a more world-like scene, as well as guidance as to where to drop future objects.
    var ground = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateGround("ground", { width: 40, height: 40}, scene);
```

## Complete Code

Provided below is the complete code for this step of the workshop.

```javascript
var createScene = function () {
    //Creating a Babylon Scene Object, using the babylon engine.
    var scene = new BABYLON.Scene(engine);

    //Create a camera object, which allows us to see the world we're building.
    var camera = new BABYLON.ArcRotateCamera("camera", -Math.PI / 2, Math.PI / 2.5, 10, new BABYLON.Vector3(0, 0, 0));
   
   //Define where the camera will be attached, in this case the canvas we are working in.
    camera.attachControl(canvas, true);

    //Creates a hemispheric light for the scene (allows for visibility of our objects)
    const light = new BABYLON.HemisphericLight("light", new BABYLON.Vector3(0, 1, 0), scene);

    //Creates a ground object, which allows us to have a more world-like scene, as well as guidance as to where to drop future objects.
    var ground = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateGround("ground", { width: 40, height: 40}, scene);

    return scene;
};
```
