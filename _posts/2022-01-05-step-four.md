## Create Meshes & Place

There are a large variety of meshes that you can create. For this workshops, we'll be using **set shapes**. Set shapes cover 2D shapes such as horizontal planes (ground), vertical planes and regular polygons along with 3D shapes such as cuboids, spheres, ellipsoids and toruses.

The position of meshes can be changed using the `position` property which is a vector object with properties x, y, and z.

Use the code snippets below to create objects for the Hall of Fame scene.

## Code Snippets

### Wall

The code below creates a wall mesh. For our setting, we will use walls to depict the ends of a forest.

```javascript
    //We declare a wall object that covers the ends of our ground on one side
    const wall = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateBox("wall", {height: 10, width: 40, depth: 0.125});
    //Declare its material
    const wallMat = new BABYLON.StandardMaterial("wallMat");
    wallMat.diffuseTexture = new BABYLON.Texture("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gcordido/babylon-student-workshop/gh-pages/textures/forest.jpg");
    wall.material = wallMat;
    //And adjust its position
    wall.position.y =  2;
    wall.position.z = 20;
```

### Wall Clone(s)

The code below creates a clone of the wall mesh. These are used to cover the rest of the ground. Add this snippet after the code for the **wall**.

```javascript
    //Cloning the original wall to recreate the rest of the forest
    const wall2 = wall.clone("wall2");
    wall2.rotation.y = BABYLON.Tools.ToRadians(-90);
    //Adjust its position to each of the ends of the ground
    wall2.position.x = -20;
    wall2.position.z = 0;

    const wall3 = wall.clone("wall3");
    wall3.rotation.y = BABYLON.Tools.ToRadians(90);
    wall3.position.x = 20;
    wall3.position.z = 0;

    const wall4 = wall.clone("wall4");
    wall4.position.x = 0;
    wall4.rotation.z = BABYLON.Tools.ToRadians(-180);
    wall4.position.z = -20;
```

### Trees

To mimic a couple of trees, we will use a box mesh.

```javascript
    //To add some trees, we will recreate them using columns!
    const tree = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateBox("tree", {height: 4, width: 0.50, depth: .50});
    const darkWoodMat = new BABYLON.StandardMaterial("darkWoodMat");
    darkWoodMat.diffuseTexture = new BABYLON.Texture("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gcordido/babylon-student-workshop/gh-pages/textures/black-wood.jpg")
    tree.material = darkWoodMat;
    tree.position.y = 2;
    tree.position.x = -2;
    tree.position.z = -1;
```

### Tree Clone(s)

The code below creates a clone of our original tree mesh. Add this snippet after the code for the **tree**.

```javascript
   //Similar to the walls, we will create clones of the original tree and adjust their positioning
    const tree2 = tree.clone("tree2");
    tree2.position.x = 2;

```

## Complete Code

Provided below is the complete code for this step of the workshop.

```javascript
var createScene = function () {
    //Creating a Babylon Scene Object, using the babylon engine.
    var scene = new BABYLON.Scene(engine);

    //Create a camera object, which allows us to see the world we're building.
    var camera = new BABYLON.ArcRotateCamera("camera", -Math.PI / 2, Math.PI / 2.5, 10, new BABYLON.Vector3(0, 0, 0));
   
   //Define where the camera will be attached, in this case the canvas we are working in.
    camera.attachControl(canvas, true);

    //Creates a hemispheric light for the scene (allows for visibility of our objects)
    const light = new BABYLON.HemisphericLight("light", new BABYLON.Vector3(0, 1, 0), scene);

    /**** Sky Color *****/
    scene.clearColor = BABYLON.Color3.Black();

    //Creates a ground object, which allows us to have a more world-like scene, as well as guidance as to where to drop future objects.
    var ground = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateGround("ground", { width: 40, height: 40}, scene);

    //This provides our ground with a given texture, by first declaring the material object
    var groundMat = new BABYLON.StandardMaterial("groundMaterial");
    //We define where the texture for the material is coming from
    groundMat.diffuseTexture = new BABYLON.Texture("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gcordido/babylon-student-workshop/gh-pages/textures/grass.jpg", scene);
    //And determine how we want to spread said texture across the ground.
    groundMat.diffuseTexture.uScale = 6;
    groundMat.diffuseTexture.vScale = 6;
    //Finally, we assign the groundMat object as the our ground object's material.
    ground.material = groundMat;

    //We declare a wall object that covers the ends of our ground on one side
    const wall = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateBox("wall", {height: 10, width: 40, depth: 0.125});
    //Declare its material
    const wallMat = new BABYLON.StandardMaterial("wallMat");
    wallMat.diffuseTexture = new BABYLON.Texture("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gcordido/babylon-student-workshop/gh-pages/textures/forest.jpg");
    wall.material = wallMat;
    //And adjust its position
    wall.position.y =  2;
    wall.position.z = 20;

    //Cloning the original wall to recreate the rest of the forest
    const wall2 = wall.clone("wall2");
    wall2.rotation.y = BABYLON.Tools.ToRadians(-90);
    //Adjust its position to each of the ends of the ground
    wall2.position.x = -20;
    wall2.position.z = 0;

    const wall3 = wall.clone("wall3");
    wall3.rotation.y = BABYLON.Tools.ToRadians(90);
    wall3.position.x = 20;
    wall3.position.z = 0;

    const wall4 = wall.clone("wall4");
    wall4.position.x = 0;
    wall4.rotation.z = BABYLON.Tools.ToRadians(-180);
    wall4.position.z = -20;
    
    //To add some trees, we will recreate them using columns!
    const tree = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateBox("tree", {height: 4, width: 0.50, depth: .50});
    const darkWoodMat = new BABYLON.StandardMaterial("darkWoodMat");
    darkWoodMat.diffuseTexture = new BABYLON.Texture("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gcordido/babylon-student-workshop/gh-pages/textures/black-wood.jpg")
    tree.material = darkWoodMat;
    tree.position.y = 2;
    tree.position.x = -2;
    tree.position.z = -1;

    const tree2 = tree.clone("tree2");
    tree2.position.x = 2;

    return scene;
