## Creating a Playground

Babylon.js provides us with a browser-based experience to test and create our Babylon.js applications. And the best part is that its sole requirement is an internet connection! This is what we call the <b>playground</b> (<a href="Playground">https://playground.babylonjs.com</a>). Through the Playground we'll be able to render our creation in real-time, and test our changes and interactions in our browser.

The Playground consists of four areas:

<ul>
<li>Menu bar (top)</li>
<li>Links bar (bottom)</li>
<li>Coding editor (left)</li>
<li>Rendering area (right)</li>
<li>Inspector (far right) </li>
</ul>

The space for the coding editor and rendering area can be adjusted by dragging the vertical bar between them.

## Instructions

1. Navigate to <a href="https://playground.babylonjs.com">https://playground.babylonjs.com</a>.
1. Verify that the chosen language is **JavaScript**.
