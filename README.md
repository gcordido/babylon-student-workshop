# Introduction to Babylon.js 

Babylon.js is a Web rendering engine that allows the creation of XR applications completely on the web. From AR, VR to WebXR support, Babylon.js provides a simple but powerful developing experience. Babylon.js has a code-first approach, and through this workshop we will build a simple scenario where a player character can move and explore a forest setting.

### Objectives

- Become familiar with Babylon.js's Playground, Inspector and Syntax.
- Create and understand scenes and their components.
- Adding meshes, materials and textures to a scene.
- Importing external models.
